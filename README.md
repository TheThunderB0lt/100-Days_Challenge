# 100_Days-Coding-Challenge 👨‍💻

## Why this Challenge ?

I need to develop myself and focus on my software profession.  I've faced a lot of rejection in my life.  To overcome this i started to do something on my own. My goal is to finish this challenge faster then expected and will try to cover all the important concepts.

So, basically, this repository has a 100-Day Coding Challenge that I'm preparing for the SDE Role, something I'm doing on my own in Python Language.

Firstly I'm fan of Python 🐍, Because i love coding in python programming language which I'm compfortable with and I started exploring all the basics of that programming language.

### Why Python?
Because Python is a very popular open-source software development language that offers enhanced process control capabilities. It is able to develop complex multiple protocol network applications while also maintaining simple and straighforward syntax.
