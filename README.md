# 100_Days-Coding-Challenge 👨‍💻

## Why this Challenge ?

In this challenge, I am doing a commitment to myself that I will try my best to first understand the algorithm behind every single problem then only I am going to start solving the problem.

I need to develop myself and focus on my software profession.  I've faced a lot of rejection in my life.  To overcome this i started to do something on my own. My goal is to finish this challenge faster then expected and will try to cover all the important concepts.

This is my Git-Hub Repository where I am going to push the code day to day from today itself to be 🎯 consistent & true with words🤗.

So, basically, this repository contains all of the important coding questions that I completed on my own in Python Language as part of my SDE role preparation.

Firstly I'm fan of Python 🐍, Because i love coding in python programming language which I'm comfortable with and I started exploring all the basics of that programming language.

### Why Python?
Because Python is a very popular open-source software development language that offers enhanced process control capabilities. It is able to develop complex multiple protocol network applications while also maintaining simple and straighforward syntax. 

### " There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hardwork and learning from FAILURE! "

- Let's see how it goes, I will be posting about end result too. Hopefully, I will be able to stand up this challenge. Exited!
- So, Here goes the Day-1..
