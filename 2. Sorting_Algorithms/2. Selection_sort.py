# Selection Sort
# In this algorithm, we create two segments of the list one sorted and the other unsorted. We continuously remove 
# the smallest element from the unsorted segment of the list and append it to the sorted segment. We donâ€™t swap 
# intermediate elements. Hence this algorithm sorts the array in the minimum number of swaps

# Selection Sort is a more efficient algorithm than bubble sort. 
# Sort has a Time-Complexity of O(n2) in the average, worst, and in the best cases.

            arr[i], arr[minpos] = arr[minpos], arr[i]   # Shortcut method for swapping

            #by using temp variable 
            # temp = arr[i]
            # arr[i] = arr[minpos]
