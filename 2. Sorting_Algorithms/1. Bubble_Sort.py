# Bubble Sort
# Simplest sorting algorithm. Iterates over the list, in each iteration it compares elements in pairs and keeps 
# swapping them such that the larger element is moved towards the end of the list.

#It has a time complexity of O(n2) in the average and worst cases scenarios and O(n) in the best-case scenario.
# Non recursive
# Stable
# In place
# O(nÂ²)

# from array import *
